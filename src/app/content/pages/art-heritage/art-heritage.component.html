                    <h2 class="custom-heading ">Our Indian Heritage Art </h2>
                    <p>Similarly, stories embedded in Indian traditional art inform our collective memory, how we as a
                        society remember our past, or how we pick what is worth taking forward that involves a degree of
                        choice in remembrance and interpretation. With this choice, we make our cultural self, how we see
                        ourselves as a part of a community, nation, or even our shared humanity. Having said that, we can
                        not see works of traditional art merely as beautiful objects. They, in their material form,
                        encompass significant events, along with narratives they convey and stories they tell, and this is
                        how we as a society continue to engage with our heritage.

                        Heritage is about processes, relationships, values, and the meanings communities attach to their
                        surroundings. Therefore, when we talk about preserving Indian traditional art, it must go beyond
                        merely promoting artworks. Real preservation is about safeguarding the cultural memory and
                        meaning-making processes embedded within each art form. In this way, traditional art will strengthen
                        community identity while encouraging its unique cultural expression. This cultural expression should
                        help us explore art forms’ cultural and historical evolution and learn how artists engage with their
                        inherited craft.

                        Though archaeology tends to focus on the antique aspect of historic and archaeological materials, we
                        can not confine heritage to the past alone. Heritage accumulates over time, engages with various
                        generations, and continues to evolve in the present. It paints an intimate connection with social,
                        economic, political, and daily aspects of people’s lives, serving as a living aspect of shared
                        history and values that sometimes make them a site of contention. Therefore, when engaging with
                        heritage, whether it’s a monument, museum, or art gallery, it’s crucial to consider the role it
                        plays in shaping cultural relationships in the present.</p>

                            <p class="second-clr">Madhubani painting, also known as Mithila art, has its origins
                                deeply rooted in the rich cultural heritage of the Mithila region in Bihar, India. The art
                                form traces its beginnings to ancient times, where it was traditionally practiced by women
                                in the region. The name "Madhubani" derives from "Madhu" (meaning honey) and "bani" (meaning
                                forest or woods), reflecting the lush, natural surroundings that inspired its early motifs.

                                The origins of Madhubani painting are often attributed to the epic times of Ramayana, where
                                it is believed that King Janaka, Sita's father, ordered his kingdom to decorate the walls of
                                his palace with intricate paintings to celebrate her marriage to Lord Rama.  </p>

                                reject much of contemporary culture. The style of Warli painting was not recognised until
                                the 1970s, even though the tribal style of art is thought to date back as early as 10th
                                century A.D. The Warli culture is centered around the concept of Mother Nature and elements

            <p>Stoneware is a type of pottery that is known for its durability and versatility, making it suitable for both functional and decorative items. It is distinguished by its firing process, which occurs at higher temperatures, typically ranging from 1,200 to 1,300 degrees Celsius (about 2,192 to 2,372 degrees Fahrenheit). This high-temperature firing results in a dense, vitrified material that is less porous and more robust compared to other types of pottery like earthenware.</p>
